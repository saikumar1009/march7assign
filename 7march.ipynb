This is the simplest measure of variability.ote in statistics (unlike physics) a range is given by two numbers, not the difference between the smallest and largest. For some data it is very useful, because one would want to know these numbers, for example knowing in a sample the ages of youngest and oldest participant. \n",

Skewness is demonstrated on a bell curve when data points are not distributed symmetrically to the left and right sides of the median on a bell curve. If the bell curve is shifted to the left or the right, it is said to be skewed.\n",

    "3.Investors note right-skewness when judging a return distribution because it, like excess kurtosis, better represents the extremes of the data set rather than focusing solely on the average.\n",
